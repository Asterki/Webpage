            <h1>About Dispatch</h1>
            <p>Dispatch is a little chat/social app created by me that is based on the functionality of WhatsApp and
                post things like Twitter does <br> This app was made as a school project and was meant to be something
                "simple" but I went a little further and tried to make it better, like add private chats or make some
                functionality like Twitter, I personally don't make apps or programs, I'm more of a web-side guy, but
                anyways, this will be in the "projects" page on my site</p>
