        		My Life
        	</h1>
        	<br>
        	<p>
        		Who can say what is their life...<br><br>
        		I was born in a country called Honduras, I wouldn't say that was an easy life, but also wasn't a bad one, i have my family, my dad and mom, all my life i was interested in computers, i think that was because at the age of 5 I got access to one, was amazing, how you can told the computer to do something and it will do, then... schools gets in the ring, first grades was easy, including Math, I'm a little good at Math, all primary i got good grades, then college comes in, 7th grade was awful, bad notes, in that time i didn't know how the things work, and everything was just hard, I still having the idea that there was some classes that are useless, anyways, that year i started learning some English (in a bigger scale) so I could speak with people that speaks that language, also know English helps you to get a work, also in some ways in programming, I started programming 2 years ago with batch, a very basic Windows language, then, I learned about Discord bots, i put interest in it, so in January of 2020 I started learning node.js, a JavaScript framework, wasn't easy but i could make some "cool" stuff with it, then i got i little bored of it, so i started looking for new things to learn, i discovered Unity, a Game Engine, i was interested in it firstly because i could create my own games, inspired by Dani (A game developer/Youtuber) i downloaded it and started learning C#... then, when i decided to open Unity, it simply crashes every time i wanted to open it, that was because i have a not very good pc (For not saying shitty) so I couldn't make anything with it, after a long time, in August i decided to learn Web Development, with my experience in node.js I started learning JavaScript in a Web Development environment, HTML, and CSS, first days... "How import css into html", "How make headers", "Why is my script not working?", yeah, bad times, after long time of learning i finally could make decent stuff with it, just like this webpage that i made in 2 hours, all using Sublime Text, Opera, and XAMPP as server, while listening to System Of a Down and Slipknot, yes, i like metal, well... I like a lot of genders but alternative metal is my favorite, going back to topic, now I'm learning Big Data, learning PHP, a little of Python, Jquery, TypeScript, Vue.js, Bootstrap, and react.js, sometimes is hell, sometimes is not, but i can do things with it! And I think that's my story, if your read all that, congrats, what's wrong with you.
